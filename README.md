Population Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing population data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to various population metrics. The analysis includes population growth, distribution, age demographics, and other socio-economic factors. The project uses datasets from various sources (e.g., census data, demographic reports) and employs data visualization techniques for better interpretation.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing of population datasets.
Exploration of population growth trends over time.
Demographic breakdowns by age, gender, region, and other factors.
Data visualizations to present trends and patterns.
Statistical analysis for forecasting population growth.
Technologies Used
